# FileAutoMover

### Also called Anti-File Cluttering For Linux

Do you have a messy desktop like this?![desktop](http://i.imgur.com/M7PXn9N.jpg)

Then this will help you sort files into their own folders depending on how you want them to be sorted.

Inspired from FileJuggler for Windows, though this one does more moving than actual monitoring.

#### TODO features:

* [x] Move files by extension names
* [x] Move files by first filename letter
* [ ] Move files by date modification/creation
* [x] Move files by filesize
* [ ] Move files by file type
* [ ] Move files according to user's custom settings (This gon' be hard)

#### Notes:

* The software just copies the files on their respected folders
* Haven't implemented deletion yet for safety
