# FileAutoMover

### Also called Anti-File Cluttering For Linux

Do you have a messy desktop like this?![desktop](http://i.imgur.com/M7PXn9N.jpg)

Then this will help you sort files into their own folders depending on how you want them to be sorted.

Inspired from FileJuggler for Windows, though this one does more moving than actual monitoring.

#### TODO features:

* [x] Move files according to their extension names
* [x] Move files according to their first filename letter
* [ ] Move files according to their date modification/creation
* [x] Move files according to their filesize
* [ ] Move files according to user's custom settings (This gon' be hard)

#### Notes:

* The software just copies the files on their respected folders
* Haven't implemented deletion yet for safety
